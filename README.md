# AI ChatBot

This project is a simple AI ChatBot with a modern user interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The chat interface is designed to work on various screen sizes.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The UI is built with Tailwind CSS for a modern and clean look.
- **Interactive Chat**: Users can send and receive messages from the chatbot.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Type your message in the input field at the bottom.
3. Press the send button to see the chatbot's response.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the chat interface.
- `assets/js/`: This directory would contain the JavaScript logic for the chatbot (if any).

## Learning Outcomes

- **API Integration**: Learned how to integrate with a third-party API (Google Gemini) using `fetch`.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Used `fetch`, `.then()`, and `.catch()` to handle asynchronous API calls.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically created and added HTML elements to the page to display chat messages.
- **Event Handling**: Used event listeners for button clicks and key presses.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Used Tailwind CSS for styling the UI.
- **Using External Libraries**: Integrated the `marked` library to parse markdown in the chat response.
